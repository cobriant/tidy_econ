#' ### 1) Show that $y_t$ is nonstationary when $y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t + u_t$, where $u_t$ ~ iid N(0, $\sigma^2$).

#'
#' ### 2) Suppose $x_t$ and $y_t$ are unrelated except that they both have time trends, so
#'
#' $y_t = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 t + w_t$
#'
#' $x_t = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 t + v_t$
#'
#' Where $w_t$ and $v_t$ are iid N(0, 1). If we estimate the model
#' $y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_t + u_t$, why do we often conclude that
#' $\beta_1 \neq 0$?
#' What will the sign of $\hat{\beta_1}$ be?

#'
#' ### 3) In the previous problem, should we expect that as the number of
#' observations $t$ increases, we find that x seems to have an effect on y less
#' often?
#'
#' For 2 points of extra credit: do a monte carlo simulation in R using `map`
#' that answers this question.
