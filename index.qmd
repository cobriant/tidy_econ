# Introduction

Welcome to *Econometrics with the Tidyverse*! I'm so happy you're here!

**Who am I?** My name is Colleen O'Briant. I'm an Economics PhD student at the University of Oregon. My research is on developing the Econometrics of machine learning and AI algorithms. I'm also very passionate about teaching, especially teaching this course.

**Who you might be:** You might be a student in an Econometrics class. I'll assume you have some familiarity with topics in economics, calculus, probability, and statistics. You don't need to be a PhD student. You also don't need to know how to program: I'll teach you, starting from zero.

By the end of this course, you will have excellent command over R (especially the Tidyverse ecosystem). You'll also solidify your understanding of statitics. And most importantly, you'll be able to think like an applied economist: to evaluate when a regression might be able to answer your research question, and when to expect biased or inconsistent results.

**Programming Goals:** The course will teach you how to write programs in R to solve your problems, with a focus on clarity and readability. You will learn to program in a functional, declarative style, and to think about using layers of abstraction to develop simple solutions to complicated problems.

**Econometrics Goals:** 

- The basics of deriving the least-squares estimators for a simple regression (Chapter 1)
- How the crucial assumption of exogeneity affects the estimators (Chapter 2)
- How exogeneity allows estimators to have a causal interpretation (Chapter 3)
- The property of consistency and how it can be used to sign the bias of estimators suffering from omitted variable bias (Chapter 4)
- Different model specifications and their interpretations (Chapter 5)
- Heteroskedasticity and how it can be caused by a misspecified model (Chapter 6)
- Topics in Time series models (Chapters 7 and 8)
- Strategies for causal inference when exogeneity cannot be assumed, including instrumental variables and the differences-in-differences estimator (Chapters 9, 10, 11)
