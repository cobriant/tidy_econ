## Overview

This repository contains all of the public course materials for EC421 *Intro to Econometrics*, which I teach at the University of Oregon as a PhD student. I've taught this class four times between Summer 2021 and Fall 2022 and it's evolved to being something I'm really proud of. It's fun and fairly easy to teach and I think students get a whole lot out of it. I'd attribute the success of the course to four major design decisions I made that are a little out of the ordinary:

1. I use the Tidyverse exclusively (no base R) to limit the scope of what students need to learn as programmers.
2. I teach the Tidyverse using homework koans. This gets the students programming on their own (doing the reps!) at least a couple times a week.
3. The class is flipped: students study the material outside of class and then *every hour of class time* (except for exam days) is spent on group work. This frees you up as the instructor to get to know your students on a more personal level, hearing their thought processes and asking the right questions to set them on the path to figuring it out on their own.
4. Because the class is flipped, you don't have to lecture at all. In fact, it's best if you limit as much as possible the time you spend at the front of the class addressing the room. That's because you want to give students as much time as possible to engage with their group. Most days, I leave the classwork printouts at the front of the room and the students get started working as soon as they enter.

If you haven't experienced a flipped classroom before, there's something really special about putting your students into small groups in front of an interesting problem. At first they flail around: you're asking them to think on the spot which is uncomfortable! But after just a couple of classes, they start to get the hang of it and then they start *loving* it. I think it's because they start to feel ðŸŒŸempowered:ðŸŒŸ they start believing that econometrics (along with programming and probability/statistics) is something THEY CAN DO, and that's a really beautiful thing.

So if you're teaching Econometrics and you're interested in using the Tidyverse and using a flipped classroom, go ahead and fork this repo and use my materials. If you like it, you can show me your appreciation by sending me pull requests whenever you change something for the better. I'd like to *collaboratively develop* this course because I think that's the best way it can continue to grow.

## Student Testimonials

*She made sure that almost every time we were learning something, we were engaging with it actively. When learning to code, she gives us interactive assignments... The fastest and best way I've ever learned to code. Every class period, we collaborate with a small group of students on problem sets that are very challenging, but with enough support from the professor, possible to do, and very growthful/educational.*

*It was honestly one of the best-taught courses I have taken in a long time at the UO.*

*I really appreciated the support from the instructor throughout the course, as well as the effort you could tell she put into organizing the class. Although we only had a month to complete a 10 week term's worth of work, I never felt rushed or left behind as we covered new and complex topics each day... In building the course, she provided students with countless opportunities for interactive and involved learning, while also leaving room for us to work through fresh material at our own pace, through the koans and lecture material. I can be certain I have a much stronger foundation in both statistics and R than I did a month ago.*

*She clearly puts deep consideration into the organization and structure of the course, and in making every part of it challenging, yet digestible and ineractive. She is also very supportive, giving guidance on how to do certain problems but always making sure you're still doing and understanding the work. Finally, she's very good at making these complicated and confusing subjects understandable, through clear and organized lessons with lots of examples.*

*This was the most engaged I've been with a class in a while. Thank you!*

## Details on Class Set-up

### Group Size

*Attribution: I took all of these strategies from my Professor Dr. David Walnut, who taught an amazing flipped math class at George Mason while I was there.*

I recommend dividing students into small groups of 3. Groups of 2 and groups of 4 are okay, but they're not quite as good as groups of 3. To ensure that students attend class, make the penalty for missing class severe: a letter off of their final grade is sufficient.

I begin the course by randomizing students into groups of 3. They keep these groups for the first 1/3 of the course. This lets them build some comfort with their group, but they don't feel stuck with them for too long.

Then for the next 1/3 of the course, I randomize them into new groups. For the final 1/3 of the course, I let them make requests about who they want to work with: they write down names for me and I try to satisfy as many of those requests as possible. Most people end up requesting their first groups: they became friends!

Even though all 17 classworks are currently published in the back of the workbook, I recommend only making them available one at a time as they're assigned. You don't want a few students to work ahead and leave their group behind. I also recommend printing out copies of the classwork for students so they have something physical to look at.

I like to make the classworks due at the end of the week. That way there's pressure in class to get it done, but it's not too urgent because they know they can think about it more after class. Then at the end of the week I post answer keys somewhere private like on Canvas. You won't find answer keys in this repo: those are up to you to create, but obviously please don't publish those publicly.

### Class Size

I find that this class works well with 30 or fewer students. Beyond 30, you may not have enough time to work with each group during every class session. One solution I've started to experiment with is to bring TA's into class. If you find a system that works well with a larger class, please add your notes to this document.

### Answering Questions during Class

As a teacher, there's an impulse to wait at the front of the room until someone raises their hand, and then walk over and answer their question. I don't recommend this. Some students figure out they can be vocal and get a lot of your attention, while other students stay silent and flounder. Both types suffer because the vocal students never get the chance to un-stick themselves when they're stuck, because they know you'll come rushing in to help.

Instead, pick a group to start with, spend a few minutes listening in on their process, offering encouragement and perhaps a suggestion, and then move on to their neighbor, working your way around the classroom until you get back to the group you started with. 2 laps in a single class period is perfect. 

It's also important to set the right tone with your advice-giving. Teachers seem to fall into two camps when it comes to giving hints: 1) they give away nothing and are vaguely mean about it, and 2) in an attempt to seem kind, they crumble and give everything away. But there's a way to avoid giving spoilers while staying kind to students: stay compassionate and get really curious about their thinking. Students will heavily imply that it's your job as the teacher to rescue them from a hard problem. You should respond with a smile and by saying, "walk me through what you're thinking about." Sometimes this is all you need to do: when they articulate their thinking to you, they see where they went wrong or they have a new idea. It's also powerful to respond to a student's reasoning by being transparent and telling them how it makes you feel: "Oh, I'm excited about that!" or, "I'm confused about what you mean by that." And even: "I'm sorry, I spaced out: can you say that again?".

Sometimes a group of students aren't prepared. You can sit with them a little while, suggest what section they might re-read in the workbook, and then come back a little while later.

### Classroom

The ideal classroom for this course would have whiteboards on all four walls and large tables for collaboration. I've never been so lucky to get a room like that, so I ordered 10 large 18"X24" white boards that students put at the center of 3-4 desks pushed together. I think when the students have large white boards to write on, they write large and collaborate well. Without white boards, students write small in their own notebooks and they don't tend to collaborate quite as well.

The whiteboards are great for the analytical math classworks, but for the programming classworks, students should bring in their laptops and the groups of 3 should sit in a little row so that everyone can see everyone else's screens.

### Teaching Online

I've taught this course both in person and online over Zoom (synchronously). When I taught it online, I used the Zoom breakout room functionality during class and it worked well. I think over Zoom, it was easier for the students to collaborate on code, but a little harder for the students to collaborate with math. I recommend encouraging students to use ipads or document cameras for this.

## Issues

Here are some areas of weakness: contributions here would be profoundly appreciated.

- Explore how to use TAs to support large class sizes.
- Transform the workbook into a professional-feeling textbook. Right now I think the workbook feels sort of like lecture notes. Context is often missing: students are expected to sort of be "on the same page" as me to understand it well. To improve the clarity and readability of the workbook: (inspiration from [Patrick Henry Winston](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY)). 
  - Start each chapter with an empowerment promise: "by the end of this chapter, you will be able to do XXX."
  - For each chapter, identify a slogan: "the key to understanding this topic is XXX".
  - For each chapter, create a symbol: a visual way to remember the concept.
  - For each chapter, include a story: who developed these ideas and how? Why did they decide to work on the problem? The details really sell it!
- Create/redo videos: I'm conflicted about the videos I've included. I think videos can be really useful, but I don't think I'm very good at making them. And it's incredibly time consuming! My thinking is that material should be presented to maximize clarity: if it's a story, write it in a paragraph so you can get the words right. If it's a complicated math proof, write it in LaTeX. If it's an example that you want students to try for themselves, that's where a video can come in handy: emphasize that they should pause the video to give it a shot, or even better, embed a quiz in the video so they have to pause and try it themselves. In any case, I think the videos could be redone.
- Break chapter 7 on Time Series into two chapters. As it stands, it's too dense and too much to ask students to read in a single night.
- Rewrite Koan 12, student feedback is that it's too confusing.
- Develop a system to automatically grade the koans. The koans have tests, but the tests can be a little fragile. A more robust way to automatically grade the koans would save you a lot of time while teaching the course.
